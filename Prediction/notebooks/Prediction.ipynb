    "##Problem Statement\n",
    "Recent advances in sensor technology, infrastructure for estimating temperature, pressure, humidity, precipitation, etc. are readily available on roadways to predict traffic states. The goal and novelty of our project is to combine streamed GPS traffic estimation algorithms with dynamic road sensor data to accurately predict traffic states and efficiently advise and direct drivers."
