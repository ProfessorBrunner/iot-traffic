#Traffic Dashboard
The dashboard acts is a visual interface for a central administrator to manage the traffic and view analysis of traffic data at a single place. It can be used to view the movement of vehicles, the areas where accidents and weather events have occurred send alerts to the vehicle drivers in real time and view charts and visualizations of the timestamped data collected. 
The server on which the traffic dashboard is hosted will need to have Flask installed

To get the Flask server up and running
```python
python run.py
```
The application will then be live at 
[locahost:5000](http://www.locahost:5000)
